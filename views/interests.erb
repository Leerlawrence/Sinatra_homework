<TD>"I Love Music"

I love music, any kind of music
I love music, just as long as it's groovin'

Makes me laugh, makes me smile
All the while
Whenever I'm with you girl
While we dance, make romance
I'm enchanted by the things that you do

I love music
sweet, sweet music
Long as it's swinging
All the joy that it's bringin'

I'm so happy to be in complete harmony,
I love you, girl
And to hold you so close in my arms
I'm so glad you're mine all mine mine

Nothing can be better than a sweet love song
So sweet
So sweet
So mellow, mellow
When you got the girl that you love in your arm
Oh honey, I love you, I love you, yeah
Music is the healing force of the world
It's understood by every man, woman, boy and girl
And that's why, that's why I say
I love music
Any kind of music
I love music
Just as long as it's groovin', groovin'

Music makes the atmosphere so fine
Lights down low
Just me and you baby, you know
'Specially when you got a cold glass of wine
Mellow, mellow wine and song

I love music
Any, any kind of music
I love music
Just as long as it's groovin'

I love, I love, I love, I love, I love music
Sweet, sweet music
I love, I love, I love, I love, I love music</TD><TD>
 

Many of the sports I am involved in and follow are about teamwork.  (There are the odd exceptions - tennis & squash being the most notable)  They are about working together, with each other's strengths and weaknesses, collectively trying to improve, compensate, utilise these to a greater good.  It's often said 'there's no 'I' in 'team''.  There are, but together those 'I's make 'we's and together, we are stronger.  I love the challenge, even in a successful period of sport to go "faster, higher, stronger", to be continually improving.  To quote the brilliant game "Bopit!", the team needs to learn to "Do it again but better..."  The victory of Leeds Rhinos at the weekend is all the more marked for me as they have built a team that has won the Super League 6 seasons out of the last 9.  They are a team that is continually evolving, bringing a good mix of youth and experience.  Long may it continue! 

We need our teammates in sport, and that helps me remember that the world, my life, my existence is not simply about me.  There are good reasons why God has put others around us to live with, work with, be friends and team mates with.</TD></TR></TABLE>
